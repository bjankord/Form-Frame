Form Up
=======

Form Up is a HTML/CSS form boilerplate used to structure forms and makes creating custom forms quick and easy.

Form Up has been designed so you can remove the parts that you don't need.
If your form doesn't have checkboxes or radio buttons, you can remove the styles for them from the CSS.
If you don't have any need for multiple fields on the same row, you can remove the Form Column styles, etc. 

Form Up has been built so that it is easy customize so you use just the CSS you need for your forms.

It's also been designed to work with [jQuery Validation](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation). I've include some sample JS files to demo how it can be used with jQuery Validation.

It currently comes in two flavors, a **fixed width layout** and an **adaptive layout**.
